<p>"Divide et impera", the world is at war.</p>

<p>
    <b>T</b>his time a war against increasing complexity.
    Our brains designed for hunting in the wild and collecting berries are only capable of processing 
    a certain amount of interconnectivity. That's the reason why all devices commonly used 
    have simple interfaces. Taking for example a Hifi-Amplifier: it has a big knob for the volume and some 
    far smaller buttons (for the advanced users :)). Because that is what an amplifier should do: amplipfy
    a signal by an amount you can control with that knob. Stand-alone it's hardly of any use, 
    so we connect it with 
    other devices via cables. These devices are following the same design principle: a simple 
    user interface (the knobs, sliders, buttons and perhaps some LED's) hiding the electrical 
    complexity inside. This makes it possible for people who never studied Electrical Engineering 
    to use this little wonders of science and hear music.

    <b>T</b>he days when a website was made of say a dozen of HTML-files and some accompanying scripts 
    are gone. A modern site is made of large code bases with thousands of files. And it's made and 
    maintained by large teams.
</p>
<p>
    <b>T</b>he development of growing complexity is also reflected
    in the development of computer languages: e.g. from Assembler to C, from C to C++, from C++ to ...
    It hadn't been possible to maintain codebases above 50.000 lines in assembler. Also C had an upper limit.
    Microsoft developed the Component Object Model (COM) in the early 90-ties. And they were maintaining a huge
    codebase with it: among others Windows. Consisting of millions of lines of code. 
    Today it's still living. I mean COM ;). 
    Large parts of the Mozilla applications (e.g. Firefox) are written with COM. They call it XPCOM. 
    The main idea behind COM is that components communicate exclusively via interfaces. 
    The implementation of the component is completely hidden. In my eyes that's the crucial part, 
    a prerequisite to reach a certain amount of application size/complexity.

    <span class="fat">Modularization and encapsulation (information hiding)</span>
</p>
<p>
    <b>T</b>he bigger the code bases are growing and the bigger the teams that are working on it the 
    more important it gets to apply clear design guide lines. Clear separation of tasks by modularization 
    combined with a declaration that specifies how a module is connected to others. 
    Without those guide lines famous software projects like Operating systems (Linux, OS X, Windows),
    Web Browsers or creative applications like 3D-Studio-Max, Photoshop and all the other large software 
    projects would not exist.<br><br>
    
    Which brings me to the next paragraph and the jungle of the 'modern' web.
</p>
<p>
    <b>T</b>he technology to write large applications had been developed in the 90ties. But why can't we 
    use it for developing web applications? Good question. One reason lies in the fact that websites
    and the codebases from which they are made of haven't been big enough to justify the use of
    software engineering techniques and tools. Another could be historical: that the internet 
    in the early days was just a collection of texts saved on university or other government servers. 
    HTML was just there to connect these texts by hyperlinks. A XML-based description of a page-layout.
    The web just a collection of pages. Not apps.
    Combining it with a script engine, to modify properties based on events was a step forward but still 
    not an application development platform. That's why Flash has been such a success. 
</p>
<p>
    So, there were two worlds. The one of large application developers and the world of Internet script 
    ninjas and communication designers. Hardly any contact between them. Doing websites has been more
    like designing a magazine. But this is changing. A lot. 
    Now mobile and internet companies are increasingly adapting concepts from the large software project 
    guys. Browers have become platforms, Operating Systems inside an Operating System. But still there 
    is this attitude from the old scripting days. So, no compiler, hidden types, no access to browser 
    platform libraries. All scripts. But this is changing (-> TypeScript, -> flowtype).
</p>
<p>
    <b>A</b>pplying the modularization and information hiding (encapsulation) manifest to current web 
    standards is still hard. Namely HTML5, Javascript a.k.a. ECMAScript and CSS3 allows us to manipulate 
    everything from everywhere. There are thousands of ways to bring the same content to a website. 
    And also ten-thousand ways to fail. No encapsulation or modularization whatsoever. 
</p>
<p>
    What could a component be? Let's take a button. It has a clear functionality. It has to react on
    mouse, keyboard or tap events and trigger an action. It has a parent HTMLElement. It has styles
    and with it comes position and size.  
</p>
<p>
    <b>Enemy N°1</b>: Global variables, global states. Everyone can change them all the time (e.g. window, 
    document, prototypes of Javascript's built-in objects, global styles)<br><br>

    If someone can change something inside a component (someone always will do) without using interface 
    methods the component will likely get into an undefined state. In other words: break, collapse, error. 
    All connected components will have problems to. The only way to prevent changing the inner live of 
    a component is to force by design that 
    <span class="fat">you can only use a component by calling interface methods</span>.
</p>
<p>
    As a consequence no component should be allowed to change the global state. Boom!
    So, no write access to document or window, no changing of built-in prototypes, no change of global 
    styles from inside a component. But then, how can we modify the DOM?
    The goal has to be that a component is only allowed to change it's own properties. Usage of 
    functions like document.createElement() or HTMLElement.remove() should be restricted.
    It should however be allowed to read properties of the surrounding DOM-tree.
    This would demand an encapsulation of the DOM-API itself. That is a big call.
    As a first step we could agree to not modify elements outside of our own scope.
    So encapsulation by code convention. Additionally a parser could check module code for
    existance of functions calls that potentially could modify the DOM.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Enemy N°2</b>: No Type checking. Good for rapid testing, not good for large projects. 
    A C++ compiler would mostly stop you from doing silly things. Sometimes it even reveals 
    errors in your software design concept. Which is great.
    Not so a Javascript interpreter, it tolerates a lot of errors silently. Incomplete objects 
    with undefined or not existing properties, assignments between incompatible types,
    function calls with missing or to much parameters. Also typos. The interpreter patiently 
    accepts it. Using 'strict' helps a bit, but cannot change the overall situation.
    It has to do with the way an interpreter works: it mainly detects errors in the code segement 
    which it currently processes. Errors in unprocessed code paths are not detected. But can 
    crash your site if a certain condition occurs that runs over a code segment that you haven't 
    tested.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Enemy N°3</b>: DOM-Tree is huge and complex. Web Design is not. The property collection of 
    DOM-Elements reads like a telephone book. Some properties are supported others not. 
    Some are added by browser vendors. Some functions are deprecated, but still working.
    Other functions are new and each vendor handles it differently. The DOM can be manipulated from 
    certain places, by dynamically adding or removing nodes, changing properties from HTML, CSS or 
    Javascript. Too bad if nodes depend on eachother. 
    Last but not least an event system that traverses the DOM-Tree. Everytime from everywhere you 
    can add or remove event handlers for each and every DOM-Node. Neither ownership nor context required. 
    All this summed up gives a nice chaotic mixture.
</p>
<p>
    <b>The solution</b> (kind of): Using a framework. Using a somewhat standardized framework
    gives us safety. If it's working for others, it should work for us to, right? But how many
    companies can compare themselves to google or facebook? Having the same needs?
    Remember Flash and Actionscript? Or maybe Silverlight?
    Who would have thought that the days of Flash were counted so abruptly? 
    Surely not Adobe and also thousands of Flash-driven companies.
    If e.g. Angular or React gets a major design overhaul, you have to follow. Although nothing 
    changed in your codebase, just to be up-to-date. Every coder has to learn the new stuff and 
    make the related changes to the depending code. And run all testinh again.
    If the companies that releases these frameworks decide to take money for it, you have to pay.
    Ok, that is unlikely to happen, but if they decide to abandon the project in favor of something
    really new and great, they can do it. Maybe you cannot.
</p>
<p>
    So, what if we decide not to use one of the major, popular frameworks?
    To put all stakes on the web standards: Javascript, CSS3, HTML5. No proprietary framework.<br> 
    Proclame that we don't need a huge framework to display our texts and images and do 
    database manipulation.
</p>
<p>
    There are some good recipes and tools one can adopt that can assist us on that path:<br><br>

    <b>1. Tools</b>: Node with npm, Webpack with linters and transpilers, a good Web-IDE<br><br>

    <b>2. Modular Design</b>: Web-Components, Modular-CSS, Custom Elements, Shadow-DOM, HTML-Templates<br><br>

    <b>3. Version Control</b>: Mandatory. E.g. Git (github.com)<br><br>

    <b>4. Exhaustive Tests</b>: Let' not overrate test driven development. Test the app/site itself. 
    There is no garantee that if our tests, written in e.g. Karma, run without errors our site runs 
    fine, too.  "Don't set a fox to keep the geese!". 
    Writing a comprehensive test for a tree class for example is not a trivial task. This takes a lot 
    of time. And the complexity of the test code is comparable to the code itself. As a consequence 
    tests are often shortcutted, slimmed. Merely testing a couple of conditions and not each 
    possible state a class can run into (which can get quite a few -> combinatorial explosion).
    Also there could be errors in the testing code as well.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Conclusion</b>: The language features of ES6, CSS3 (CSS4 is comming) and HTML5 should have 
    all you will ever need. But they have to be combined with at least two main design principles: 
    Modularization and Encapsulation. Modularization naturally includes another famous rule: DRY, 
    Don't repeat yourself! Also the KISS-rule (Keep it ssimple!). Base Modules have to be as simple 
    as possible. This increases the chances for successful reuse of code by combining it with other 
    modules. Then, in the end our projects become module/component trees (Similar to the DOM itself).
    From my first experiences I can tell, that it's crucial to write the base components with great
    care. They will be the building blocks for all other components. If something is not right
    with them, these quirks will influence and dampen any further development. A good component is one
    that is simple to use and to understand and easily combined with other components.

<p>
    <b>T</b> his site is my humble attempt to tame the DOM, with the above written in mind.
    It's neither meant to be a replacement for a framwork nor is it a framework.
    I just wanted to see how far I can get without a framework. And if it's possible to write
    components that can be plugged into the DOM making as few assumptions as possible. In particular
    no framwork dependencies.
</p>
<p>
    I used JQuery a bit, but decided to remove it from future code. It does not make the code clearer.
    It also seems to have it's own messaging and data-binding system. Unnessacarily.
    For conversion from XML to JSON (to feed the TreeView) I used xml2js. That's it, the rest is all 
    pure Javascript (ES6).
</p>
<p>
    More to come. All work in progress. All experimental. Still learning something new every day.
