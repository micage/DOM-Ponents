TreeView:
    implement ObservableTree!

    edit node label

    add/remove items -> create dialog

    show/hide nodes, unhide all, hide others
    same with lock/ unlock

    give leaf-nodes a z-value and a transform matrix

    multi-selection (by pressing SHIFT for ex.)

    Items: path, circle, rect, line, text, ... make their props editable

Animations: Black Hole
    Transformations by altering node trafo matrix
    maybe give nodes a cb function that has to provide values 
    for a given point in time

    an item which has been loaded or created is unique and not visible and not 
    part of the scene. Using it in a scene would require creating a reference to it

    sorting of styles

Space Partitioning/ Visibility: e.g. quad tree, k-D tree
    visibility check vs. brute-force painting, measure times!
