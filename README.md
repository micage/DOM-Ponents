# react-webpack-cordova-boilerplate

Quickly and easily start a react/cordova app using webpack.
### Installing

Kind of a weird install would be easier as a git.

```
Create new folder

Enter that folder

Run: npm i react-webpack-cordova-boilerplate

Go into node_modules and cut/copy
the contents of react-webpack-cordova-boilerplate

Paste them in the same directory as node_modules

Run: npm i

Finally, Run: npm run dev
```

## Commands


```
npm run dev
//starts dev server on port 3333

npm run pro
//builds the bundle.js that you can then put on a server somewhere

npm run and
//builds the bundle.js then packages it into android and runs android

npm run ios
//builds the bundle.js then packages it into ios and runs ios
```

If anyone can find a good way to do this on a node server let me know
node doesn't have access to AudioContext or OfflineAudioContext
